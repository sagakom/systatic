# Systatic
> Static Site Generator built on components from the Laravel framework

* Collections - You can fetch your data from Markdown files or you can get them from remote locations (like a headless CMS).
* Serverless (quite literally) - Put your site in Git, create a site on Netlify and you're done, essentially.
* No Frontend Stack - We don't predefine your front-end, we leave that up to you. You'll only going to rip it out anyway.
